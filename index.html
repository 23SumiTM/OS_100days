        <h1>100daysofcode reminder app</h1>
        <p>Do you ever get to the end of the day and say to yourself, "I'll record my coding work tomorrow!", but then the next day comes and the same thing happens and so on...</p>
        <p>If that sounds like you, this is the app for you. This is an Opensource project, designed by new(ish) software engineers involved in "Coding with Drew", which aims to remind you to record your 100daysofcode work every day.</p>
